Tutor.Log.Log1,"Hi there, I am your tutor!",那边的小子你好，我是你的导师！
Tutor.Log.Log2,"Good morning, I am glad to seeya here",早上好，很高兴在这里见到你
Tutor.Log.Log3,"Now, I will teach you how to make these apes evolute into human beings",现在，让我来教你怎么让这群猩猩进化成人类。
Tutor.Log.Log4,"Now on the screen are two apes, orange for the male and pink for the female.",现在在屏幕上的是两只猩猩，橙色代表雄性猩猩，粉色代表雌性猩猩。
Tutor.Log.Log5,"They will mate when they are sexually mature, and pregnant females display in cyan. after a pregnancy cycle, the females will give birth.",它们性成熟之后就会进行交配，怀孕的雌性猩猩会显示为青色，经过怀孕周期后，雌性猩猩将分娩后代。
Tutor.Log.Log6,"When there are many apes in the scene, the opposite sex prioritizes the search for the most attractive potential one.",当有很多猩猩存在的时候，异性之间会优先寻找最具吸引力的潜在对象。
Tutor.Log.Log7,"The baby apes will inherit the genes of their parents, but may also mutate to produce new genes, depending on the "mutation points" of their parents.",后代将继承父母的基因，不过也有可能突变产生新的基因，这与父母的“突变指数”有关。
Tutor.Log.Log8,"See the emoji in the upper left corner? It represents the existential pressures the ape community is currently facing.",看到左上角的表情了吗？这代表了猩猩族群目前面临的生存压力。
Tutor.Log.Log9,"Resources are finite, and once the number of members reaches a certain size, the pressure will prevent the apes from reproducing.",资源是有限的，当族群内成员的数量达到一定规模之后，巨大的生存压力将阻碍猩猩们繁衍后代。
Tutor.Log.Log10,"However, as a trainee God, you have the power to carry out a premeditated massacre!",不过，作为实习上帝，你有能力进行一场有预谋的的屠杀！
Tutor.Log.Log11,"See the four cards below? Each card corresponds to a disaster. These disasters can help you filter out good ape individuals.",看到下面的四张卡牌了吗？每一种卡牌都对应了一场大灾难。这些灾难可以帮助你筛选出优秀的猩猩个体。
Tutor.Log.Log12,"Next to the existential stress indicator is the current gene point total of the group, the better the ape individual the more gene points it can contribute.",生存压力指示器边上的是族群目前的基因点数总和，越优秀的猩猩个体所能贡献的基因点数越多。
Tutor.Log.Log13,"When the sum of gene points breaks through the maximum, the apes are genetically good enough, which means they can evolve into humans.",当基因点数总和突破最大值的时候，猩猩们的基因就足够优秀了，这代表它们可以进化成人类了。
Tutor.Log.Log14,"At this point your mission is also complete, so congratulations on your official promotion to God of this planet!",这时你的任务也完成了，恭喜你正式晋级为这颗星球的上帝！
Tutor.Log.Log15,"But when the apes goes extinct, I must also regretfully inform you that you failed the test.",不过当族群灭绝时，我也得遗憾的通知你考核失败了。
Tutor.Log.Log16,"Okay, is that all clear now? Then let's officially start the test!",好吧，现在都明白了吗？那让我们正式开始考核吧！
Main.Log.Ice,"There have been several ice ages on Earth, and only the smartest apes can find a way to survive the cold weather.",在地球上曾经发生了数次冰期，只有最聪明的猩猩才能找到在天寒地冻的环境中生存下来的方法。
Main.Log.Plague,"What a disaster!",真是一场大灾难！
Main.Log.Volcano,"It sucks that half of the several species extinctions that I can count were caused by volcanic activity.",数的上来的几次物种大灭绝中，有半数都是由火山活动引起的，真是糟糕啊。
Main.Log.Solar,"Do you like sunbathing?",你喜欢日光浴吗？
Main.Log.Log1,"Apes typically reach sexual maturity at 16 years old, which is similar to humans, but their average lifespan is only about 35 years.",猩猩的性成熟一般在16岁，这和人类类似，但它们的平均寿命只有35岁左右。
Main.Log.Log2,"When existential stress is too high, female apes tend to abort or give birth to stillborn babies because their own nutrition no longer supports the birth.",生存压力过大的时候，雌性猩猩趋向于流产或产下死胎，因为它们自身的营养已经不支持生产。
Main.Log.Log3,"If there is no pressure, they can reproduce indefinitely until the planet is crowded with apes.",如果没有压力，它们可以无限繁衍下去，直到这颗星球挤满猩猩为止。
Main.Log.Log4,"I'll be watching you to keep track of your every move during the test.",我会盯着你，以记录你在考核期间的一举一动。
Main.Log.Log5,"Those apes gathered in the center are really chaotic!",那些聚集在中心的猩猩真的太混乱了！
Main.Log.Log6,"You can cast as many disasters as you like, but be careful not to accidentally make an entire community extinct.",你可以随便施放灾难，但小心别把整个族群不小心搞灭绝。
Main.Log.Log7,"There are some good genes, but they are rare. There are also some bad genes, but again, they are rare.",有一些基因非常优秀，但它们是罕见的。也有一些基因非常垃圾，但同样也很罕见。
Main.Log.Log8,"Our time flows 100 times faster than the apes' or it would be too hard to get through.",我们的时间流速是猩猩们的100倍，不然也太难熬了。
Main.Log.Log9,"Well, the pass rate on this test isn't high actually, hahaha.",这场考核的通过率其实不高，哈哈哈。
Main.Log.Log10,"You can roughly determine the age of an ape by the size of the point.",你可以通过圆点的大小来粗略地判断猩猩的年龄。
Main.Log.Max,"What a mess, you should do something about it or they can only reach such heights!",真是一团糟，你应该做点什么了，否则它们只能到达这样的高度！
Main.Log.Lose,"You get F!",你搞砸了！
Main.Log.Win,"Congratulations, the test period has been passed, and now you are the only God on earth!",恭喜你，试用期已经通过了，现在你就是这片大地上唯一的神！
